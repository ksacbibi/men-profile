My theme for this website is my friend group that I met in high school. I love these friends very much and will take any opportunity to show my appreciation for them. While I\'m away at university, most of my friends are still back at home in Hamilton. Because of this, I haven\'t gotten to hang out with them very much. I miss them dearly, and I\'m eager to see them again once the study term ends.',

				description: 'Sara is one of my best friends. I met her in 6th grade, and we\'ve been best friends ever since. We initially bonded over Minecraft, often joining a Skype call after school and playing on multiplayer servers with each other. She\'s always been someone who I could be myself with; I realized that no matter how weird I was growing up, she always laughed along with me and joined in on my weirdness. I\'m glad she\'s still one of my closest friends to this day.',

				description: 'I met Michael in kindergarten. Michael is another one of my really close friends. Growing up, we played all sorts of video games together - from elementary school to post secondary! Our gaming friendship first started off with Minecraft, then he got me into one of my most favourite games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. For years he\'s been one of the people I trust the most. He never fails to make me laugh. He recognizes boundaries and respects them. A truly valuable friend.',

				description: 'I met Abby in high school. I don\'t remember when we first officially met, but we became closer in 11th grade. Her, our friend Alicia, and I didn\'t have many friends to eat lunch with during first semester of grade 11, so we ate lunch together. We ended up getting even closer in grade 12, through the creation of the Men server. I love the vibes that Abby gives off. When I think of her, I immediately think of sunshine and cute dinos. That\'s her. She also makes some weird noises sometimes. But I love that too.',

				description: 'Christopher. I met Chris in high school, but got closer with him through our mutual friend group, Men. I think we really bonded over video games. We once played League of Legends for 8 hours straight. I would usually get bored after playing a game for an hour or two, but with Chris I was able to play all day. He gives off child-like happiness vibes, which always manages to put me in a good mood when I\'m around him. Well, when he\'s not complaining, that is. Only joking! (Not really.) For real though, he can be really funny and can really lift my mood up.',

				description: "Connor is one of the smartest people I know. I met him in high school, but never really spoke to him until the summer before 12th grade, which was around the time of the formation of Men. He helped me through grade 12 Functions as he had taken it the year before, and he is very good at explaining math concepts. He got accepted into Waterloo Engineering with me, and he studies Biomedical Engineering. To this day, I still sometimes turn to him for help. His smarts truly amaze me and I know that he will be very successful one day.",

Fech and I have always had mutual friends, and we got closer through hanging out in these mutual friend groups. Although he makes very bad jokes, he makes up for it through his very kind personality. Fech is one of the kindest people I know; he respects everyone he meets, and would never hurt anyone\'s feelings.',

All throughout high school, Brian has always been good at math, and has often been someone I would go to for help. In grade 11, we started getting closer through our computer science class and video games. I'm very comfortable around Brian since we share common interests and a sense of humour.",

				description: "Nina is one of the sweetest girls I know. We met in grade 10 and since then she's always felt like family -- maybe because we're both Filipino? Anyway, whenever I talk to her she's always smiling. Her vibes are so pure, just being near her lifts up my spirits. I'm actually the one who invited her to the Men server, so that she can play Valorant with all of us. She was a very wholesome addition to our friend group.",

She always makes me laugh; her laugh is contagious and I love it. We have the type of friendship where we can make fun of each other, but we laugh with each other. She's also one of the hardest working people I know, working during the day, studying during the night, and caring for her family all the while. She's one of the people I trust the most, even if she can be a little silly sometimes. She's such an amazing person, and I'm so proud of her.",

He's been with his girlfriend, Tharani for a few years now, and I know that he loves and cares about her very much. He is the definition of a gentleman, respecting everybody he comes around. Although I'm not very close with him, I know that he is an amazing person through how I've seen him with Tharani and his behaviour when we all hang out. I don't think this man could even hurt a fly.",

When high school came around, we didn't really talk much as we had separate friend groups. However, in grade 12, when Men was formed, we became closer again. Hanna gives me bunny vibes. The happy, bouncy vibes. When I think of her, I can always picture her smiling. I know that she's been through a lot in her life, and yet she still manages to have such a cheery vibe whenever I'm around her. I hope that she knows that our friend group is always there for her, and that I'm so proud of how strong she is.",

I remember she always had amazing hair every day, no matter what the style was. Tina is the mom of the group. During our Men cottage trip, she cooked most of our meals and cleaned the kitchen every day. She has worked many jobs I believe this has led to her excellent leadership skills. Tina has taken care of pretty much everyone in the friend group at some point in time, as well as keeping them in check. She is the definition of 'small but mighty.'",

In grade 11, we would have late night talks on Discord, along with other people, and that was when we actually got to know each other. Rafay went through some major weightloss in high school, which I am very proud of him for. It took a lot of dedication to get to where he is today. He is also one of the most fashionable people I know. He also has a stellar beard, which I know he takes the time to groom regularly. The effort he put in to look good every day is not going unnoticed!",

She was top of our grade all throughout high school and I am very proud of her hard work. I am sure she will go very far in life. Tharani is also very sweet, which is one of the things that make her and Marcus such a perfect match for each other. She also has amazing dance moves; I probably rewatched her dance Tik Tok 100 times. (It's so good.) ",

She was always someone I told all my boy drama to and I often went to her for advice. We hung out quite often, going out for food or shopping together, but haven't really had a chance to since university started. I miss her very much. She is always there for me when I need her, and I for her. I can see that she cares about all her friends, and she often asks me if I'm okay if I'm seeming off. I know I can always count on her.",
